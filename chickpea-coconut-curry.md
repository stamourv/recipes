# Chickpea Coconut Curry

Ingredients can all be kept in the pantry, so great "d√©panneur".
Could be made vegetarian by switching the broth, if you cared.

## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 cans chickpeas
* 4ish medium potatoes, peeled and chopped
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 can pineapple chunks
* 1 14 oz can coconut milk
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1 1/2 tsp curry powder (I like Trader Joe's)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp hot pepper sauce (optional)

## Directions

* Put everything in crock pot. Stir.
* Cook on low 6-8 hours.
* Serve on rice.

## Notes

* Original recipe called for 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, but
  those always ended up bland. Better with chickpeas.
* Works well with frozen pineapple too.

## Source

Original recipe, with chicken instead of chickpeas, and with many other
differences, is from The Slow Cooker Bible, p.128.
