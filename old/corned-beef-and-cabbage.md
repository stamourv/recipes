# Corned Beef and Cabbage

Perfect around St. Patrick's day, when corned beef and cabbage are on sale.

## Ingredients

* ~3lb corned beef
* 1/2 small cabbage, in wedges
* 4ish medium potatoes, in cubes
* 2ish carrots
* minced garlic
* 2 tbsp pickling spices (I like McCormick's)

## Directions

* Oil the crock pot to avoid sticking.
* Put spices in a cheesecloth "bag", to avoid having to pick our shards
  of bay leaves from the meat.
* Put potatoes, carrots, onion, and garlic at the bottom.
* Add meat and cabbage. May need creativity to fit everything.
* Cover with water.
* Cook on high for 8 hours.
* Don't be afraid to take out some of the liquid if it's spilling.
  That recipe can really fill a crock pot.

## Notes

* The other half of the cabbage head is a perfect invitation to make
  cole slaw.
