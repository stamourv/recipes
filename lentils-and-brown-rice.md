# Lentils and Brown Rice

Vegetarian.
Another really simple rice cooker recipe. And good "dépanneur", since
all the ingredients can keep in the pantry.
Should be pretty healthy, and definitely tasty.
A batch makes about two meals, but want to complete with some crudités
or something.

## Ingredients

* 1/3 cup green lentils
* 1/3 cup brown rice
* 2 cups water
* 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes
* minced garlic to taste (lots)
* 2 tsp (kosher) salt
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* ~2 tsp seasoning (I like Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute)

## Directions

* Put everything in the rice cooker. Putting rice and lentils last makes
  it easier to stir things well.
* Turn the rice cooker on. Wait until it's done. That's it.
  In mine, it takes about an hour.

## Notes

* Fills my rice cooker completely. More would make a mess. You may want
  to adapt for different-sized rice cookers.
* In my rice cooker, at least, this takes a lot longer than the
  equivalent amount of rice. It could be that I'm adding too much water
  here. More experimentation is needed, but this version is fine; it
  just takes a while (but that's passive time).
* I've read about people starting by heating the oil in the bottom of
  the rice cooker first, then browning the garlic, then adding the rest
  of the ingredients. That sounds delicious and definitely worth trying.

## Variants

* Any kind of lentils and any kind of rice could also work. I like the
  green lentils for the texture, but I've used red too. Jasmine rice
  also works, but brown rice is more nutritious.
* Any seasoning could work, really. Adding some tomato paste and umami
  seasoning both work well. Oregano plus umami seasoning gives a nice
  italian-ish flavor.
* Could use stock instead of water to cook the rice and lentils.
* In theory, adding other vegetables could be nice. I've tried green
  beans, corn, and sliced black olives. None of these are as good as
  plain tomatoes. YMMV.
