# Lentils and Brown Rice

Vegetarian.
Another really simple rice cooker recipe. And good "dépanneur", since
all the ingredients can keep in the pantry.
Should be pretty healthy, and definitely tasty.
A batch makes about two meals, but want to complete with some crudités
or something.

## Ingredients

* 1/3 cup green lentils
* 1/3 cup brown rice
* 2 cups water
* 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes
* minced garlic to taste (lots)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* ~3 tsp seasoning (I like Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute)

## Directions

* Put everything in the rice cooker. Putting rice and lentils last makes
  it easier to stir things well.
* Turn the rice cooker on. Wait until it's done. That's it.

## Notes

* Fills my rice cooker completely. More would make a mess. You may want
  to adapt for different-sized rice cookers.
* Could use some broth instead of the water (then may not be vegetarian).
* Any seasoning could work, really.
* And other vegetables could work too: corn, green beans, olives, etc.
  Canned is easier.
* I've read about people starting by heating the oil in the bottom of
  the rice cooker first, then browning the garlic, then adding the rest
  of the ingredients. That sounds delicious and definitely worth trying.
