# Fusili Casserole with Ros√©e Sauce

Vegetarian.
Takes a bit of work (about an hour) but well worth it.
The sauce is much better than something pre-made, and grilled
cheese and breadcrumbs on top is delicious.
Makes four modest servings (or three solid ones).

## Ingredients

* 6 oz fusili
* 1 head of broccoli or cauliflower, cut into smallish pieces

* 1 onion, diced
* minced garlic
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp basil
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes OR 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes, blended a little
* 1 8 oz can tomato sauce
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

* 4 oz fresh mozzarella
* panko breadcrumbs

* olive oil
* grated parmesan (optional)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 475F.
* Do a mise en place. There's lots of things happening at once;
  you'll need it.
* Heat a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fusili and broccoli
  until the fusili are al dente (about 7-8 minutes) then drain.
* Meanwhile, cook the garlic, onion, and herbs in a pan, with olive
  oil.
* Once the onions are cooked, add the crushed tomatoes and tomato
  sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for about 5 minutes.
* Then, add the cream, mix in well, and simmer for another minute.
* Assemble the casserole: mix the pasta, broccoli, and sauce in a
  casserole dish.
* Top the casserole with panko breadcrumbs. You want a lot.
* Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and spread on the top.
* Cook for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese and breadcrumbs start to
  brown.
* Drizzle some olive oil on top, and add parmesan to taste.
* Let rest 10-15 minutes, then serve.

## Notes

* Could add some pancetta or bacon for a non-vegerarian version.
* Another non-vegetarian option is to add anchovies to the sauce. A couple of
  fillets adds some depth to the sauce. Careful not to overdo it, though, to
  not end up with a fishy-tasting sauce.
* An 8oz container of fresh mozzarella, and a large broccoli (or two small
  ones) makes for two recipes. So I usually do two batches back to back.
