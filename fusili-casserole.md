# Fusili Casserole with Ros√©e Sauce

Vegetarian.
Takes a bit of work (about an hour) but well worth it.
The sauce is much better than something pre-made, and grilled
cheese and breadcrumbs on top is delicious.
Makes four modest servings.

## Ingredients

* 6 oz fusili
* 1 head of broccoli or cauliflower, cut into smallish pieces

* 1 onion, diced
* minced garlic
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp basil
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
* 1 8 oz can tomato sauce
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

* 4 oz fresh mozzarella
* panko breadcrumbs
* olive oil

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 475F.
* Do a mise en place. There's lots of things happening at once;
  you'll need it.
* Heat a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fusili and broccoli
  until the fusili are al dente (about 7-8 minutes) then drain.
* Meanwhile, cook the garlic, onion, and herbs in a pan, with olive
  oil.
* Once the onions are cooked, add the crushed tomatoes and tomato
  sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for about 5 minutes.
* Then, add the cream, mix in well, and simmer for another minute.
* Assemble the casserole: mix the pasta, broccoli, and sauce in a
  casserole dish.
* Top the casserole with panko breadcrumbs. You want a lot.
* Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and spread on the top.
* Cook for 10-15 minutes, until the cheese and breadcrumbs start to
  brown.
* Drizzle some olive oil on top. Let rest 10-15 minutes, then serve.

## Notes

* Could add some pancetta or prosciutto for a non-vegerarian version.
* Can put the garlic separately on top, rather than mixed in the sauce.
* Original recipe called for saving 1/4 cup of the pasta water.
  We have more liquid in the form of the tomato sauce, so that makes
  the casserole a bit too runny.
