# Apple Croustade (AKA Crumble)

Great dessert. I'm not a dessert person, yet I make it every apple season.
Always a hit at potlucks and parties.
Has a cult following. Seriously.

## Ingredients

Fruit filling:
* 4-5 apples
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 tbsp lemon juice

Crust:
* 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
* 2/3 cup quick oats
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup butter

## Directions

* Preheat the oven to 375F.
* Grease a baking dish.
* Peel the apples and cut in chunks. Put in the baking dish.
* Add the (filling) brown sugar and the lemon juice. Stir.
* Melt the butter (mine is usually frozen) in the microwave, at low power.
* Mix all the crust ingredients together.
* Spread the crust over the fruit filling.
* Cook 30 mins.

## Variants

* Works with other kinds of fruit, too. At various points, I tried
  canned pears or peaches, in addition to or instead of apples. Pears
  in particular give a mellower, less tart flavor than apples. Even did
  banana slices once. All of these worked great.
* For even more crust, can do 1 cup each of flour and oats. A bit more
  brown sugar can help too.

My mom. Then I doubled the crust, which is the best part.
