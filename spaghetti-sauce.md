# Spaghetti Sauce

An excellent bolognese-like sauce.
I most often use it for lasagna, rather than directly for, e.g.,
spaghetti.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 cup celery, chopped
* 1 onion, chopped
* 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
* 1  6 oz can tomato paste
* 2+1 14 oz cans tomato sauce
* 3-4 bay leaves
* 1+1 tbsp sugar
* 2+2 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp corn starch
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp basil

## Directions

* Take one can of tomato sauce, 1 tbsp sugar, 2 tsp salt, and the corn
  starch, and mix them together.
* Brown the ground beef on medium-high heat.
* Drain the excess fat (if you want), and set the beef aside.
* Sauté the celery and onions on medium heat, until onions are
  translucent. You can do that in the large pot to use for the whole
  sauce.
* Add the beef, tomato products, and seasonings.
* Simmer for 2 hours.

## Notes

* Makes enough for two full lasagnas.
* Freezes really well. Always worth having in the freezer.
* Can also put the raw meat in the pot, at the same time as the tomatoes
  and everything, rather than browning it first. Just be sure to stir a
  lot to avoid clumps.
* Can replace one can of tomato sauce and the associated sugar, corn
  starch, and salt mixture with one can of tomato soup. These are
  usually 10oz, so that's a bit less liquid, but not a huge deal.
  The original recipe went with tomato soup, but I prefer having fewer
  distinct ingredients. (Plus, TJs doesn't sell canned tomato soup...)
  Creating the tomato soup "substitute" may not need to be a separate
  step, and/or may not be necessary at all. More experimentation needed.

## Variants

* Can add mushrooms, or carrots.
