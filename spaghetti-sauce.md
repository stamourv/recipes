# Spaghetti Sauce

An excellent bolognese-like sauce.
I most often use it for lasagna, rather than directly for, e.g.,
spaghetti.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 cup celery, chopped
* 1 onion, chopped
* 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 28 oz can tomato sauce
* 1 ~6 oz can tomato paste
* 1 10 oz can tomato soup
* 3-4 bay leaves
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp basil
* 1 tsp sugar

## Directions

* Brown the ground beef on medium-high heat.
* Drain the excess fat from the pan, and set the beef aside.
* Sauté the celery and onions on medium heat, until onions are
  translucent. You can do that in the large pot to use for the whole
  sauce.
* Add the beef, tomatoes and tomato products, and seasonings.
* Simmer for 2 hours.

## Notes

* Makes enough for two full lasagnas.
* Freezes really well.
* Could add mushrooms, or carrots.
* Can also put the raw meat in the pot, at the same time as the tomatoes
  and everything, rather than browning it first. Just be sure to stir a
  lot to avoid clumps.
