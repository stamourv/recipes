# Veal Escalopes

A fair bit of work, but a very nice treat.
Great for a slightly fancier dinner.

## Ingredients

* 6 veal escalopes (scallopini), about 1/4" thick
* 1 - 1 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
* 3 tsp grated parmesan
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 2 eggs, slightly beaten
* minced garlic
* 2 tsp water
* butter or olive oil for cooking

## Directions

* Mix the eggs, the water, and the garlic.
* Mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan, salt, and pepper.
* Dip the escalopes in the egg mix, then dredge in breadcrumbs.
* Cook in a pan with butter or olive oil. Medium-low heat works well, to
  avoid burning them.

# Mushroom Sauce

## Ingredients

* 1 cup sliced mushrooms (crimini work well)
* 3 tsp butter
* 2 tsp flour
* 1 cup beef stock
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* butter or olive oil for cooking

## Directions

* In a pan, cook the mushrooms in butter or olive oil.
* In a saucepan, melt the 3 tsp of butter on medium heat.
* Add the flour, stirring with a whisk, to make a roux.
* Cook 3-5 minutes or until it simmers.
* Add the stock, stirring constantly.
* Cook until the sauce thickens.
* Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper, and oregano.

## Notes

* Serve the escalopes with the sauce, ideally with some sides (green beans
  are good).
* Can substitute very thin steak for the veal.
* Can add oregano or french fried onions to the breadcrumbs.
