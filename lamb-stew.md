# Lamb Stew

Quite filling.
The lamb is very tender.
The flour on the meat thickens the stock into a really nice gravy.
The kind you should mop up with some bread.

## Ingredients

* 2-2.5 lbs lamb / mutton stew meat
* 1 onion, chopped
* 4ish potatoes, in cubes
* carrots
* celery
* minced garlic
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce

* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp thyme
* 1/2 cup flour

* beef broth, to cover (4 cups should do it)

## Directions

* Mix the flour and spices in a ziploc bag.
* Put lamb cubes in the bag, and shake to cover.
* Put other ingredients in the crock pot.
* Brown lamb cubes in a pan, then put on top of the vegetables.
* Cover with broth.
* Cook 8 hours on low.

## Notes

* Could try with bacon, with leek, with parsnip or turnip, with ale (or
  even whiskey), with bay leaves or rosemary, etc.
