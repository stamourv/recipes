# Pulled Pork

A nice, hearty protein to build a meal around.
Pretty low effort, and freezes very well.
Worth always having in the freezer to whip up a quick meal.

## Ingredients

* boneless pork roast (3-4 pounds)

* 3/4 cup ketchup
* 1/4 cup cider vinegar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tbsp yellow mustard
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp garlic powder

## Directions

* Cover bottom of slow cooker with water.

* Place roast in slow cooker, season all sides with salt and pepper.

* Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.

* Take roast out of slow cooker, let it rest about 15 minutes. Discard
  the liquid.

* While the roast rests, mix the barbecue sauce.

* After the 15 minutes are up, shred the roast using two forks.

* Return meat to slow cooker, add barbecue sauce, mix well, and cook on
  high for 30 minutes.

## Notes

* Goes well with cole slaw or roasted vegetables, and some nice bread
  or potatoes. For whatever reason, I don't tend to eat it as a
  sandwich.

## Variants

* In a pinch, you can replace the homemade barbecue sauce with store-
  bought. Not as satisfying though.

Pork was improvised, sauce is from my mom.
