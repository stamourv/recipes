# Rice and Beans

Dead simple recipe for the rice cooker.
Convenient for packing lunches; a batch makes about two meals.
Funny enough, tastes better when microwaved.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 measure of white rice (using rice cooker measuring cup)
* 1 can diced tomatoes, drained
* 1 can pinto beans
* 3/4 can water
* garlic
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp tomato paste (optional)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp thyme
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp paprika (smoked is great)
* shredded pepper jack

## Directions

* Put everything except the cheese in the rice cooker, then turn it on.
* When it's done, add the cheese and let it melt.

## Notes

* When making ahead of time, let cool divide into portions, then add the
  cheese. The cheese will melt when reheating.
* May want to adjust quantities for different rice cookers.
  The above is the most I can fit in mine without a mess.
  Would probably want to keep rice/water ratio constant, though.
* Could use cheddar instead of pepper jack.
* Can add corn, celery, different beans, etc. Just make sure not to make
  the rice cooker overflow.
