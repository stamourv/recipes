# Recipes

This repo contains various (food) recipes I use (and like!). Some of
them are family recipes, some I got and/or adapted from online, and some
are my own.

Pull requests in the form of food are always welcome.

This is a work in progress. Not only in the sense that I'm always trying
new recipes and tweaking old ones, but rather more in the sense that I'm
only partway through transcribing / translating / cleaning up my recipes.
(In particular, these first few recipes skew crock-pot-heavy, per request.)
