# Recipes

This repo contains various (food) recipes I use. Some of them are family
recipes, some I got and/or adapted from online, and some are my own.

This is a work in progress. Not only in the sense that I'm always trying
new recipes and tweaking old ones, but rather more in the sense that I'm
only partway through transcribing / translating / cleaning up my recipes.
(In particular, these first few recipes skew crock-pot-heavy, per request.)
