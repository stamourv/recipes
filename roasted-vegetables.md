# Roasted vegetables

More of a technique than a recipe, but such a nice and versatile side
that it's worth listing!
Goes with pretty much any dish, really.

## Ingredients

* Mix of hardy vegetables: I like fennel, cauliflower, carrots, sweet
  potatoes, and onions (yellow or red both work).
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper

## Directions

* Preheat the oven to 450F.

* Cut vegetables into ~1in dice or ~1in wide strips. Even pieces means
  even cooking!

* Toss vegetables in olive oil, salt, and pepper.

* Put vegetables on a parchment-lined sheet tray, or some oven-safe dish.
  Try to leave some space between the pieces, so they cook well.

* Roast for ~25 minutes, until some of the edges are crispy and the
  pieces are tender.

## Variants

* Other vegetables could work too. Other hardy ones like squash would
  probably give a similar result.

* Can add other seasonings. Would go well: oregano, garlic powder,
  smoked paprika, etc.
