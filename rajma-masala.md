# Rajma Masala with Cauliflower

Vegetarian.
Fairly low effort recipe.
All the ingredients can be kept in the pantry (or the freezer) which
makes this a good "d√©panneur".

## Ingredients

* 3 cans kidney beans, rinced and drained
* 1/2 head of cauliflower, in small pieces OR 1 bag frozen cauliflower
* 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes
* 1 onion, chopped
* minced garlic
* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp curry powder (I like Trader Joe's)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp tomato paste (optional. 1/2 can is also ok)

## Directions

* Put everything in the crock pot. Usually easier to put beans and
  cauliflower last. Stir.
* Cook on low for 6 hrs, ideally stirring every 2 hr.
* Serve on rice.

## Notes

* With frozen cauliflower, makes it even easier to just always have the
  ingredients on hand. Also makes it less necessary to make the recipes
  two weeks in a row to use up a whole cauliflower head (or just throw
  it away), which gets pretty tiresome.
* Originally used only 2 cans of kidney beans. The 3-cans version is
  more filling, but could maybe use a bit more seasoning.
* Once substituted the onion with green onions and 1 tsp onion
  power. That worked.
* Once did 2 cans of beans and 4ish potatoes. The potatoes didn't end up
  very tender or tasty, so not worth doing again.
