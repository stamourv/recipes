# Rajma Masala with Cauliflower

Vegetarian.
Fairly low effort recipe.
Aside from cauliflower, all the ingredients can be kept in the pantry,
which makes this a good "d√©panneur" (and frozen cauliflower could make
this *all* the ingredients).

## Ingredients

* 3 cans kidney beans, rinced and drained
* 1/2 head of cauliflower, in small pieces
* 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes
* 1 onion, chopped
* minced garlic
* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp curry powder (I like Trader Joe's)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp tomato paste (optional)

## Directions

* Put everything in the crock pot. Usually easier to put beans and
  cauliflower last. Stir.
* Cook on low for 6 hrs, ideally stirring every 2 hr.
* Serve on rice.

## Notes

* Worth trying with frozen cauliflower. Would make it even easier to
  just always have the ingredients on hand. Would also make it less
  necessary to make the recipes two weeks in a row to use up a whole
  cauliflower head (or just throw it away), which gets pretty tiresome.
* Originally used only 2 cans of kidney beans. The 3-cans version is
  more filling, but could maybe use a bit more seasoning.
* Once substituted the onion with green onions and 1 tsp onion
  power. That worked.
