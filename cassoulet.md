# Cassoulet

French analog of chili.
Lives and dies by the sausage. So better find a good one.

## Ingredients

* 3 15.5 oz cans great northern beans
* 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 package of sausage, ideally a good andouille, though kielbasa can work
* 1 big onion, chopped
* minced garlic
* 1/2-1 cup of white wine (to taste)
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 2 tsp dried parsley

## Directions

* Chop sausage into small pieces.
* Fry onions in a pan, if you feel like it. Possibly sausage too.
* Put everything in the crock pot. Stir.
* Cook on low 6-8 hours.

## Notes

* Lingui√ßa may work here? Worth trying.
* Trader Joe's andouille is too bland for this recipe. Avoid.
* Pork chops are slightly better than bland sausage, but not super
  exciting. Adding bacon doesn't help.
