# Fajitas

Surprisingly simple, and really delicious.
Always happy to eat the leftovers, and sad when they're gone.
Pretty filing, too. Makes 4 solid meals.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

* 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 2 onions
* 2-3 bell peppers
* olive oil
* 1 lime

* 12 tortillas
* toppings: I like cheddar, salsa/pico, cilantro (nice, but optional)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 400F.
* Mix all the spices.
* Cut the chicken, onions, and peppers into strips. Uniform strips =
  uniform cooking.
* Toss the chicken, onions, and peppers with olive oil and the spice mix.
* Put the mixture in one or more oven-safe dishes. Ideally, you don't
  want to pack them too much. But don't lose sleep over it; the pieces
  are small.
* Bake ~30 minutes, stirring halfway through.
* After you take things out of the oven, stir in the juice of the lime.

## Notes

* That's a *lot* of seasoning, but I think it works well. Original
  recipe had half as much, which wasn't enough IMO. The optimum may be
  somewhere in the middle.

## Variants

* The protein is pretty flexible; the taste is really more from the
  spices. I could see this working with steak, halloumi, or even tofu.
* Toppings are also flexible. Sour cream could work well. I've also done
  refried beans, but the result was a little too filling.
