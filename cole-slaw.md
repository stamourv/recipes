# Cole Slaw

Best cole slaw I've ever had.
Goes great with lasagna. Grand-maman always serves them together,
because she knows these are my two favorite recipes of hers.

## Ingredients

* ~1/2 cabbage head, cut in small pieces or shredded
* ~2 branches of celery, chopped
* ~1 small onion, chopped
* 1 cup mayo
* 1/4-1/3 cup milk
* 2 tbsp cup vinegar
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp pepper

## Directions

* Mix the sauce (everything except vegetables).
* Gradually stir the sauce into the vegetables, stirring well.
* Refrigerate at least 30 mins before serving.

## Notes

* Great for using the cabbage left over from making corned beef and
  cabbage.
* Adjust quantity of sauce to the quantity of cabbage.
* Sauce can also be used for macaroni salad or potato salad.
