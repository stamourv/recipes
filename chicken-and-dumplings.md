# Chicken and Dumplings

A bit heavy, so best for winter.
Can be adapted in many, many ways, some lighter.

## Ingredients

* 2-3 lb boneless chicken (breasts, thighs, whatever)
* 1 large can cream of mushroom
* carrots
* celery
* onion
* 1 tsp thyme
* ~1/2 cup white wine
* Pillsbury (or generic) biscuit dough

## Directions

* Put everything except the biscuit dough in the crock pot. Stir.
* Cook 8 hours on low, or 4 hours on high.
* 30-45 mins from the end, mix in pieces of biscuit dough, to make the
  dumplings.

## Notes

* Could use other creams as base. Cream of chicken doesn't add much,
  though.
* Instead of biscuit/dumplings, can use boxed stuffing. Prepare it with
  1/2 as much water as normal.
* Potatoes also substitute well for dumplings.
* Mushrooms are a nice addition, portobello work well.
* For a lighter variant, can skip the dumplings and replace the cream
  with chicken (or beef!) broth. May want to add more spices (oregano,
  bay leaves) and garlic.
