# Jerk Chicken

My take on the famous jamaican dish.
Probably not very authentic, but always a hit!
Great to bring to barbecues.

## Ingredients

* 3 scallions, chopped
* 1 onion, chopped
* minced garlic
* 2-3 jalapeños, deseeded seeds
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup white vinegar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I usually use olive oil
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 2 tsp jerk seasoning (I like Badia's best)
* 1 1/2 lb skinless, boneless chicken thighs (breasts are fine too)

## Directions

* Cut the chicken breasts to be half the thickness (marinates better and
  cooks more evenly).
* Mix everything except the chicken into a marinade.
* Poke the chicken with a fork, to help the marinade.
* Marinate the chicken for at least a day.
* Cook however you like.

## Notes

* It's great on the grill, but the oven (350F for 30ish mins, with the
  marinade) works too. Tends to be dry when cooked in a pan.

## Variants

* Scotch bonnet peppers would be much more authentic, but they're harder
  to find, and also MUCH hotter than jalapeños.
* For a vegetarian version, excellent with portobellos. 4 per recipe.
  Goes great with halloumi cheese for a bit of extra protein.
* Some recipes add lime juice, or cinnamon, or black pepper, etc.
* Could use a different, more flavorful vinegar. But with so much other
  flavors going on, not sure it would be noticeable.
