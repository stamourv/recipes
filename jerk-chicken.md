# Jerk Chicken

My take on the famous jamaican dish.
Probably not very authentic, but always a hit!
Great to bring to barbecues.

## Ingredients

* 3 scallions, chopped
* 1 onion, chopped
* minced garlic
* hot peppers. I usually go with 2-3 jalape√±os, without seeds, but
  scotch bonnets would be more authentic (but much hotter)
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup white vinegar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I usually use olive oil
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 2 tsp jerk seasoning (I like Badia's best)
* 1 1/2 lb skinless, boneless chicken breasts

## Directions

* Cut the chicken breasts to be half the thickness (marinates better and
  cooks more evenly).
* Mix everything except the chicken into a marinade.
* Poke the chicken with a fork, to help the marinade.
* Marinate the chicken for at least a day.
* Cook however you like. It's great on the grill, but the oven (350F for
  30ish mins, with the marinade) works too. Tends to be dry when cooked
  in a pan.

## Notes

* Some recipes add lime juice, or cinnamon, or black pepper, etc.
