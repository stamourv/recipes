# Meatloaf

Good recipe to make in bulk and freeze.
Definitely needs some sides to make a meal out of it, though;
it's basically just meat.

## Ingredients

* 2 lb ground beef
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 10 oz can tomato soup

## Directions

* Mix everything together. Easier to add ground beef last.
* Put in an oven-safe dish of whatever shape you want.
* Cook at 350F for 1 hr. Can optionally continue at 300F for 1/2 hr.

## Notes

* Once tried with ground chicken and cream of mushroom. It was not very good.
* Can substitute basil (or some other herb) for the oregano.
