# Fèves au Lard

Québec-style baked beans.
Nice for a heavy breakfast, or a light meal.

## Ingredients

* 3 cans great northern beans
* 6oz bacon = ~10 slices = ~1/2 a pack
* 1 onion, diced
* 1/3 c brown sugar
* 1/2 c maple syrup (get the real thing)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground mustard
* pepper to taste

## Directions

* Put all the ingredients in a slow cooker.

* Cook on high for 4-5 hours, or low for 8-10 hours, stirring every
  hour or so if you can. (No big deal if you can't.)

## Notes

* Can cook overnight, to have ready for breakfast. That means no
  stirring, but not a big deal.
