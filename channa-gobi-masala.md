# Channa Gobi Masala

Very nice vegetarian recipe.
Makes 4-5 pretty filling meals.
With frozen cauliflower, can be done entirely from pantry/freezer;
makes a good dépanneur.
Serve with rice.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp garam masala
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 turmeric
* 1/4 ground ginger
* 1-2 dried thai chili
* pepper

* 1 onion, diced
* garlic, minced
* 1/2 head cauliflower or 1 bag frozen cauliflower
* 1 14 oz can chickpeas
* 1 14 oz can tomato sauce
* 1/4 cup water

* 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt
* juice of one lemon
* fresh cilantro

## Directions

* Combine all the spices in a bowl.
* Sauté onion and garlic over medium heat, until onion is translucent.
* Add spices to the pan, cook for one more minute.
* Add cauliflower, cook for another 5 minutes or so. Stir to make sure
  everything is coated in spices.
* Add the chickpeas, tomato sauce, and water.
* Simmer over medium-low heat for ~30 minutes, stirring from time to time.
* Turn off the heat, add the yogurt and lemon juice.
* Top with fresh cilantro.

## Notes

* Rice serves double duty both as a starch, and to mop up the sauce
  (which really shouldn't be left behind). Naan (or just bread) would
  work too. Potatoes less so.
* Looks like a lot of spices, and it is; that's a lot of flavor.

## Variants

* The original recipe has 1/3 cup of heavy cream instead of yogurt.
  That works fine. I just always have yogurt on hand, but hate to buy
  cream for just one recipe; always end up wasting some of the rest.

* The "heat source" is flexible. The original recipe uses cayenne, which
  works fine. Fresh chilies or chili flakes would be fine too; all this
  is just for heat, not so much for flavor.

* The fresh topping is also flexible. I'm also done green onions, and
  it's great too.

* Fresh ginger could work instead of ground. 1/2 tbsp would work.
