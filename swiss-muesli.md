# Swiss MÃ¼esli (sic)

Nice, filling breakfast.
Does require preparing it the night before, so the oats have time to
soak and soften, so takes some thinking ahead.

## Ingredients

* 2/3 cup old fashioned oats
* 1/3 cup plain yogurt
* 1/3 cup milk
* dried blueberries (I like Trader Joe's), or other dried fruit or nut
* maple syrup, or sweetener of choice
* extra milk when serving

## Directions

* Mix the oats, yogurt, milk, and blueberries in a bowl.
* Cover the bowl, and leave in the fridge overnight.
* To serve, add maple syrup, and enough more milk to get the desired
  texture.

## Notes

* Can scale recipe up and down easily, just keep the proportions.
