# Chili

Rich, savory, and smoky chili, with just a bit of a kick.
Packs so much flavor that I usually make it vegetarian; any meat that
goes in there would be overpowered anyway.
Makes 5-6 portions, and freezes well.

## Ingredients

* 1 (12oz) pack Trader Joe's "beefless ground beef"
* 2 cans black beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes, undrained
* ~1 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1-2 onions, chopped
* chopped hot peppers. 1-2 jalape√±os or ~5 dried thai chilies are good
* 3-4 cloves minced garlic
* juice of 1 lime

* 2 tbsp chili powder (I like Badia's)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 2 tsp (kosher) salt
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp umami seasoning

## Directions

* Put everything in the crock pot. Stir.
* Cook for 8-10 hours on low, or 4 hours on high.

## Notes

* Topping with cilantro, or even green onion, gives a nice freshness.
  So if you have some around, great place to use it up. If you don't,
  no big deal.

* Topping with grated parmesan, for some extra saltiness and umami,
  is also nice. Pepper jack or cheddar may be more fitting, and would
  probably work too.

* Topping with some crackers, or tortilla chips, makes for a mix of
  textures, which is nice. But not essential.

## Variants

* This recipe is pretty flexible on the protein; there's enough flavors
  from the rest. The original version used 2lb ground beef, which is
  good, but 1lb is enough. With ground beef, you'll want to brown it
  before mixing it in, and skip the extra oil (the fat from the meat
  is enough). Straight rehydrated TVP (rather than some pre-seasoned
  mix) could also possibly work but you may want to add some umami
  seasoning, amoong other things.

* Adding in some cornmeal could give a different, thicker texture if
  that's your thing.
