# Chili

Can be made vegetarian, with barely any noticeable difference.
I usually make it vegetarian, actually.
Freezes well.

## Ingredients

* 1 pack Trader Joe's "beefless ground beef"
* 2 cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes, undrained
* 1 8 oz can tomato sauce
* 2 onions, chopped
* 1 green pepper, chopped
* hot peppers. I usually add 1-2 jalape√±os
* minced garlic
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 2 tbsp chili powder (I like Badia's) OR the following
* 1 tbsp (smoked) paprika
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder

## Directions

* Cook ground beef in a skillet until no longer pink, or otherwise
  prepare your protein of choice.
* Put everything in the crock pot. Stir.
* Cook for 8-10 hours on low, or 4 hours on high.

## Notes

* The ground beef replacement (seasoned TVP?) works really well here!
  There's enough flavor, and with a slow cook, it gets really tasty.
  Could even add some umami seasoning to make it even closer to beef.

## Variants

* This recipe is pretty flexible on the protein; there's enough flavors
  from the rest. The original version used 2lb ground beef, which is
  good. But 1lb may be enough. Rehydrated TVP could also possibly work.
  I once tried going with extra beans (28oz black beans) but the result
  was too soupy.

* Could try with some brown sugar or molasses.
