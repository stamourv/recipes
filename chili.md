# Chili

Can be made vegetarian, with barely any noticeable difference.
I usually make it vegetarian, actually.
Freezes well.

## Ingredients

* 2 lb ground beef OR 2 cups TVP (measured dried, then rehydrated)
  OR 1 pack Trader Joe's soy-based ground beef replacement (found refrigerated)
* 2 cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes, undrained
* 1 8 oz can tomato sauce
* 2 onions, chopped
* 1 green pepper, chopped
* hot peppers. I usually add 1-2 jalape√±os
* minced garlic
* 2 tbsp chili powder (I like Badia's)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper

## Directions

* Cook ground beef in a skillet until no longer pink, or otherwise
  prepare your protein of choice.
* Put everything in the crock pot. Stir.
* Cook for 8-10 hours on low, or 4 hours on high.

## Notes

* Could be good with some cumin.
* Once tried replacing the ground beef with a *big* can of black beans
 (1 lb 13 oz). It worked ok, but may have been too liquid.
