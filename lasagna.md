# Lasagna

Nice, hearty lasagna. One of my favorite dishes.
Easy to make from spaghetti sauce that was made ahead of time, and
possibly frozen.
I still can't make it as good as grand-maman, though.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 recipe spaghetti sauce (see `spaghetti-sauce.md`)
* ~1/2 8 oz box pre-cooked lasagna
* ~1/2 lb mozzarella, shredded (avoid low-fat, doesn't grill well)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350F.
* Pile up sauce, pasta, sauce, pasta, etc., then sauce.
  If using pre-cooked lasagna, the pasta must be covered in sauce, to
  "cook" properly.
* In the oven, put a baking tray larger than the lasagna dish, to catch
  spills.
* Cook covered (aluminum foil works) for 35 mins.
* Remove cover, add cheese, and cook uncovered until cheese is grilled.
  Can take maybe 20-25 mins. Increasing temp to 400F can help.

## Notes

* Could use non-pre-cooked lasagna, but would be more tedious to make.
* Cooking times are approximative. Best to just look at the cheese.
