# Banana Muffins

Good as snacks, or have a few for breakfast.
Eat them within a few days, otherwise they get sticky.

## Ingredients

* 4 very ripe bananas, squashed into a mush
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 egg, slightly beaten
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 1/2 cup unbleached flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 cup chocolate chips

## Directions

* Preheat the oven to 350F.
* In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
* In another (larger) bowl, mix the egg, vanilla, sugar, and oil.
* Gradually mix the dry ingredients and the bananas to the second bowl,
  alternating the two.
* Add the chocolate chips.
* Pour into a muffin tin, ideally with paper cupcake wrappers in the
  holes.
* Bake at 350F for 30 minutes.

## Notes
* Can freeze ok.
* Can also make it as one big loaf of banana bread.
* Can add grated zucchini, which changes texture (but not really taste,
  interestingly).
* Can add cinnamon, or a bit of nutmeg.
* Can add 2 tbsp ground flax seeds or ground almonds, for a nutty taste.
  Add at the same time as the chocolate chips.
