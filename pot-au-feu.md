# Pot au Feu

Hearty beef stew from home.
Especially nice during the winter.

## Ingredients

* ~2 1/2 lb beef roast
* 1 sliced onion
* 4ish potatoes, in large cubes
* carrots, cut in sticks
* celery, cut in sticks
* minced garlic
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 3-4 cups beef broth
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp celery seeds
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Directions

* Sear the outside of the meat in a pan. Can skip if lazy, but makes a
  difference.
* Pour some broth in the crock pot, then add spices and tomato paste. Stir.
* Put the vegetables in, celery and carrots last (easiest to move later).
* Put the meat on top. May need to move some vegetables to the side of
  the meat, to get everything to fit.
* Add broth to cover everything.
* Cook 5-6 hours on high, or 10-12 hours on low.

## Variants

* Could add cabbage, mushrooms, or turnip.
* Could add red wine, or Worcestershire sauce (3 tbsp should be about right).
