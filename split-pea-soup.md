# Split Pea Soup

A nice cold-weather recipe.
Hearty enough to make a light meal on its own, but best as a starter.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup split peas (yellow is what I get)
* 1 onion, chopped
* ~2 carrots, chopped
* ~2 branches of celery, chopped
* minced garlic
* 4 tsp olive oil
* 1 tsp oregano
* 2-3 bay leaves
* 3 cups chicken stock
* 1 cup water
* salt to taste
* pepper to taste

## Directions

* Rince the split peas in cold water.
* Heat the oil in a pot on medium heat.
* Fry the onions until translucent.
* Add the carrots, celery, garlic, oregano, and bay leaves.
* Cook 5 mins, stirring occasionally.
* Add the peas, stock, water, salt, and pepper.
* Bring to a boil, then reduce heat.
* Let simmer uncovered for 1 hr, until peas are tender.
* Adjust texture if need be either by adding water, or letting liquid boil off.

## Notes

* Apparently can be frozen, but I haven't tried.
* Can replace some of the onion with leek.
* Can substitute oregano with savory.
* To make heartier, can add some ham or ham bones. Then with some nice
  bread, becomes a decent light meal.
